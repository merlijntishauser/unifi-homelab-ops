# Product Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-03-15

## Completed

Items shipped across all phases. Kept for historical context.

- **Analysis fidelity** -- static analyzer checks, simulator parity, golden test fixtures, AI analysis reliability with site profiles and caching
- **Secrets and auth hardening** -- env/secret-file credential sources, app auth gate with HMAC cookies, CORS lockdown, deployment docs
- **E2E confidence** -- production Playwright suite, Alembic migrations, structured logging, CI e2e-production job
- **Frontend scaling** -- TanStack Query data layer, component extraction, sticky matrix headers, healthcheck startup race fix
- **Multi-module platform** -- rebrand to UniFi Homelab Ops, sidebar navigation, module routing, settings modal with tabbed panes
- **Topology module** -- device map (ReactFlow), SVG diagram with pan/zoom/export, device detail panel with port table
- **Metrics module** -- background poller, 24h SQLite retention, anomaly detection, notification drawer, device grid with sparklines

## General / Sitewide

### Prometheus metrics endpoint

Add a `/metrics` endpoint exposing Prometheus counters and histograms for controller fetches, AI calls, cache hit/miss, and request latency. Optional -- zero-config if not scraped.

### Site Health AI (Phase 4)

Unified AI analysis across all three modules. Context assembly from firewall (grade distribution, findings), topology (single points of failure, VPN status), and metrics (anomaly notifications, trend outliers). Dedicated `/health` view with severity-grouped finding cards linking to the relevant module. Cached by composite key (firewall hash + topology hash + metrics timestamp). Requires all three modules producing data.

### Outbound URL validation and log redaction

Add HTTPS enforcement and domain allowlist for AI `base_url` to prevent credential leakage to unintended hosts. Audit and redact sensitive data (API keys, response bodies) from server-side log output.

### Responsive layout

On narrow viewports (<768px), sidebar collapses to bottom tab bar. Primary target is desktop and NOC screen use.

### Enterprise-scale sites (100+ zones)

Virtualized matrix rendering (TanStack Virtual or similar) for grids beyond 50 zones. Graph viewport culling and lazy edge rendering for large topologies. Zone search/filter input for both matrix and graph views. Graph clustering for dense zone groups.

## Firewall Module

### Template-based fixture generation

Define site archetypes as parameterized templates and generate fixture sets programmatically for broader regression coverage. Follows after hand-crafted fixtures prove the golden test pattern.

### RulePanel hook extraction

Split the two reducers in RulePanel into `useSimulation()`, `useAiAnalysis()`, `useRuleWrite()` hooks. Follow-up to the file extraction once it settles.

### Operator workflow: remediation flows

Add remediation-oriented flows: suggested next actions, rule diffs, and before/after validation via simulation. Add export/share paths for findings and posture reports to support review and change management workflows. Rule enable/disable and reorder already shipped.

## Topology Module

### Upstream: add `model_name` to `DeviceStats`

Add `model_name` field to `DeviceStats` in [unifi-topology](https://github.com/merlijntishauser/unifi-topology/issues/19) so device cards and panels show the friendly name (e.g. "UniFi Cloud Gateway Fiber") instead of the model code (e.g. "UCGFIBER"). Currently worked around by using the model code.

---

## Metrics Module

### Customizable card metrics

Allow users to select which metrics/information are shown in the device cards overview. Store preference in User Settings. Possible options: CPU, memory, temperature, client count, uptime, traffic, PoE consumption.

### Configurable anomaly thresholds

Anomaly check thresholds are hardcoded (CPU >80%, memory >85%, temperature >80/95C, PoE >90%). A User Settings pane could expose per-check threshold configuration stored in SQLite.

### Extended retention

24-hour rolling history is sufficient for real-time monitoring. A future option could extend to 7-day or 30-day retention with downsampled data points. Users wanting longer retention should use UnPoller + Grafana.

### Sparkline chart library upgrade

Current sparklines are custom inline SVG. If richer interactivity is needed:

- **Recharts** (~150KB): full-featured React charting with tooltips, axes, responsive sizing
- **@visx/shape + @visx/scale** (~40KB): D3-based React primitives, middle ground for axes and tooltips
